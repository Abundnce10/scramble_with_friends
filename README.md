## Scramble with Friends

# To run

1. Run 'ruby main.rb' in the command line
2. Add your letters when prompted (ie helloworld)
3. View the possible words and values in the output


# Note
* I need to find a better dictionary that includes more words
* I need to incorporate DW, TW, DL, and TL scores for individual tiles
