## Scramble with Friends

# To run

1. Run 'ruby main.rb' in the command line
2. Input the letters of your board (Left to right, top to bottom) 
	For example: astrlpiseovuzong
3. View the words in order of values (ascending)


# Future iterations
* I need to find a better dictionary that includes more words
* I need to incorporate DW, TW, DL, and TL scores for individual tiles
